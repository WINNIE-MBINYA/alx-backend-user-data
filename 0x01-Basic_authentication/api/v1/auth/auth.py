"""Module for API authentication

This module defines the `Auth` class, which serves as a template for
managing API authentication in a Flask application. It provides
methods to determine if a given path requires authentication,
retrieve the authorization header from a request, and identify
the current user based on the request.

Classes:
    Auth: A class that defines methods for managing API authentication.

Methods:
    require_auth(self, path: str, excluded_paths: List[str]) -> bool:
        Determines if a given path requires authentication.
        
    authorization_header(self, request=None) -> str:
        Returns the authorization header from the request.

    current_user(self, request=None) -> TypeVar('User'):
        Returns the current user based on the request.

    The `Auth` class provides methods to manage API authentication.

    This class is intended to be a base class for implementing
    different authentication mechanisms. The methods are currently
    placeholders and will be implemented in subclasses or extended
    later.

    Methods:
        require_auth: Determines if a given path requires authentication.
